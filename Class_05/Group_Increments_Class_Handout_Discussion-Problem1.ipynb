    "The release of energy as the double bond is hydrogenated appears to be about $16~\\frac{kJ}{mole}$ greater for methylenecyclohexane compared to 1-Methylcyclohexene. However we can attribute approximately $10~\\frac{kJ}{mole}$ of this effect due to the fact that 1-Methylcyclohexene is a triply substitued double bond compared to methylenecyclohexane being double substituted ($-116.6$ vs $-106.6~\\frac{kJ}{mole}$. So we could estimate the difference in strain energy to be about $6~\\frac{kJ}{mole}$.\n",
