    "### Discussion \n",
    "The strain energy does not significantly change between cyclobutanone and cyclobutanol. This is reflected in the heats of hydrogenation of the pair. they are similar. The heat of hydrogenation is for the group alone since strain energy provides no change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strain energy does change for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol.  Cyclohexanone has a strain energy component whereas cyclohexanol has almost none (as expected). We observe an extra 10 or 20 kJ/mole released with hydrogenation of cyclohexanone compared to a linear ketone (no data was found for 2- or 3-hexanone so I used data for 2- and 3-pentanone.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So cyclohexanol is easier to hydrogenate compared to cyclobutanol. Was that the way you expected it to go?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Benefits of a Documented Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially my results made no sense. Eventually I realized that I had failed to include the group increment for the alcohol oxygen (i\\[\"O-CH\"\\]). Having a set of code that I could check helped locate that error. Also, it would have helped others find my mistake if I had not corrected it. Everyone can see exactly how I calculated the heats of formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will also be easy to alter the code for cyclopentanone/cyclopentanol and other pairings. Give that a try."
