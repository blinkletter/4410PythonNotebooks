### pS+ is the reported value for pS+
### delta_H and delta_S are the thermodynamic parameters determined by the authors in kJ/mole and J/mol.K, respectively
### "k(A,R)x10^5" is the measured rates at 293.15K.  We will need to calculate rates for 313.15K
### BUFFER is the buffer used in each set of experiments
